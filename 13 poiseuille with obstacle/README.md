In this experiment the aim is to find the fluid velocity around an cylindrical obstacle when it is hit by a laminar stream of fluid. For example, it is expected that high Reynolds numbers lead to the generation of a [von Kármán vortex street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_vortex_street).
